The end goal of this project is to make a mock galaxy catalogue for a *WFIRST* ultra deep field (UDF). In this post I will determine what simulation box size I will need in order to create a light cone (I plan to follow the notes by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190608355H/abstract"> Hollowed 2019 </a>)  the corresponding mass resolution. If we are not able to get the required resolution we will need to tile the simulations to create the light cone.

## Ultra Deep Field

One advantage to UDFs with *WFIRST* is that it will cover 100x the area of *Hubble* and *JWST* surveys. The current status on the UDFs can be found in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019BAAS...51c.550K/abstract"> Koekemoer et al. 2019 </a>. Overall, the UDF will have an area of $$\sim 1\,{\rm deg}^2$$ and will probe to magnitudes of $$m_{AB}\sim 30$$ at redshifts beyond $$z \sim 9-10$$.


## Box Calculation

First, I calculated the proper distance as:

$$\chi = \int_0^z \dfrac{c}{H(z')} dz'$$

using the Friedmann equation to calculate $$H(z)$$, with a Planck cosmology. Then, the angular diameter distance is:

$$d_A = \dfrac{S_k(\chi)}{1+z} = \dfrac{\chi}{1+z}$$,

where in the last equality I assumed a flat cosmology.

Then, if we consider that the actual size at redshift $$z$$ is $$x=d_A \theta$$, we can find comoving boxsize $$x/a = (1+z) x$$ as a function of redshift for an angle of $$\theta = 1\, {\rm deg} = 0.017 \, {\rm rad}$$, as shown in the plot below (remembering to multiply by $$h$$):

Bruno had calculated this in the past <a href="https://bvillasen.github.io/blog/astro/cosmology/wfirst/2017/06/22/wf_box_size.html"> here </a> and decided on a box size of $$115 {\rm Mpc} \, h^{-1}$$. I don't entirely follow his calculation, and he used $$\theta=0.78 \, {\rm deg}$$ for the angle (I'm not sure where this number is from, but it might be more accurate than the one I am using). However, I also find that a boxsize of $$115 {\rm Mpc} h^{-1}$$ seems reasonable.



## Mass Resolution

To calculate the mass resolution in a box of $$115 {\rm Mpc}\, h^{-1}$$, I first calculated the total mass in the box $$M = \rho_b \, {\rm boxsize}^3 = 3 H^2\Omega_M / 8 \pi G $$, and then divided it by the number of particles.

I found a total mass of $$8.69 \times 10^{16} M_{\rm sun}/h$$, with resolutions of:

| Number of particles | $$128^3$$ |  $$256^3$$ |  $$512^3$$ |  $$1024^3$$ |  $$2048^3$$ |
| Mass per particle $$[M_{\rm sun}/h]$$: | $$4.14 \times 10^{10}$$ |$$5.18 \times 10^9$$| $$6.47 \times 10^8$$ | $$8.10 \times 10^7$$ | $$1.01 \times 10^7$$ |


Bruno found similar (but not identical numbers)

## Conclusions

Therefore, if we run simulations with a box size of $$115 {\rm Mpc}\, h^{-1}$$ and $$2048^3$$ particles, particles will have a mass of $$\sim 10^7 M_{\rm sun}/h$$. Assuming that we will resolve halos with more than 100 particles, this means the smallest resolved halos will have masses of $$\sim 10^9 M_{\rm sun}/h$$. This seems okay to me (but I will see what Brant thinks). The other option is to use a smaller box size and then tile them.
