In the <a href="https://ndrakos.github.io/blog/mocks/Halo_Mass_Function/">previous post</a>, I was checking my measured halo mass function from the test simulation against the theoretical mass function. There were a couple of bugs in the theoretical calculation, which are now fixed, and here is the resulting plot:

Therefore, I conclude that the stellar to halo mass relation does not look right below $$M =12 M_\odot h^{-1}$$ because of resolution issues.
