In subhalo abundance matching (SHAM), you assume that the abundance of halos as a function of their mass (or some other mass proxy), $$n(x)$$ is related to the stellar mass function $$ \phi (M_*')$$ as follows:

$$\int_x^\infty n(x') {\rm d}x' = \int_{M_*}^\infty \phi (M_*') {\rm d}M_*â€™$$

While there are different mass proxies, $$x$$, used in the literature, we will adopt $$v_{\rm peak}$$, which is the peak maximum circular velocity, $$v_{\rm max}$$,  a halo reaches in it's accretion history. This mass proxy seems to reproduce clustering results better than other quantities (e.g. <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.477..359C/abstract">Campbell et al. 2018</a>). Presumably, $$v_{\rm peak}$$ will be equal to $$v_{\rm max}$$ at the current redshift for host halos, and equal to $$v_{\rm max}$$ at accretion for satellite halos.

## Current Method

(1) Get/run a simulation

(2) Run a halo finder and merger tree generator on the simulation (we use AHF)

(3) Measure $$v_{\rm peak}$$ for every halo (and also construct the halo mass function, $$n(v_{\rm peak})$$)




## What's Next

While the current implementation has zero free parameters, it does not contain any scatter in the stellar mass -- halo mass (SMHM) relation. That will be the topic of the next post.
