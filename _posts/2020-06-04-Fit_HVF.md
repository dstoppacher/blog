I plan on fitting the halo $$v_{\rm peak}$$ function from the simulations to use in the abundance matching step. Here is my set-up for the $$512^3$$ simulations (I will have to update this with the higher resolution simulations)


## Functional Form

I am following the functional form from <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.469.4157C/abstract">Comparat et al 2017</a> (originally from <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.462..893R/abstract">Rodr'{i}guz-Puebla et al. 2016</a>):

$$ \log_{10} \left[ \dfrac{v_{\rm peak}^3}{H(z)^3} \dfrac{dn}{d \ln v_{\rm peak} }\right] $$

$$= \log_{10} \left[ A \left( 1+ \dfrac{v_{\rm peak}}{v_{\rm cut}}\right)^{-\beta} \exp \left[ \left(-\dfrac{v_{\rm peak}}{v_{\rm cut} \right)^{\alpha} \right] \right] $$

There are four parameters to fit $$A$$, $$v_{\rm peak}$$, $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$. I will use velocity units of km/s and have $$H(z)$$ in units of km/s/Mpc. The number density, $$n$$ is in $${\rm Mpc}^{-3}$$

As in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.469.4157C/abstract">Comparat et al 2017</a> I will also consider distinct and satellite halos seperately. Each parameter can be expressed as a polynomial in redshift $$p(z)=p_0 + p_1 z + ...$$ 

## Fit at redshift zero

First, here is the fit for the final snapshot, using all the halos with $$\log_{10} v_{\rm peak}>2.2$$

Looks like it is working pretty well (clearly it will be better with the higher resolution simulations).



## Redshift trends

Next I will look at how the four parameters vary with redshift... I will need to calculate $$v_{\rm peak}$$ for the halos in each snapshot (I have a script to do this, by reading in halo catalogs, and using the merger trees to find $$v_{max}(z)$$.) I will work on automating this to run on all snapshots.
