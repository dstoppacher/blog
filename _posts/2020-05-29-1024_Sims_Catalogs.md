AHF is crashing while trying to read in the snapshot files. Not sure why.

The error message is:

```
FATAL: No clue what kind of floating point uses 0 bytes. Aborting reading.
FATAL: Expected to read 0 particle positions, but only got 4512357996.  Aborting.
```


## Check Snapshot

I checked that the final snapshot looks okay:

Here is the snapshot at the $$512^3$$ resolution

And with $$$1024^3$$ particles:

The snapshot looks great, so it seems that the simulation ran fine.

However, I wasn't able to read in the 1024 snapshot with <code>yt</code> or <code>pynbody</code> (though I could read in the 512 snapshot). So I think there is something different about how the snapshot is formatted... I was able to read it in fine with my own code though, so I am not sure what is different. I need to look into this further, and maybe change the function in AHF that reads in the GADGET files.
